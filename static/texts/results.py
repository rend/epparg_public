  "analysis": "In de 'ABN Offer.pdf' wordt een acceptatieverklaring beschreven waarin de klant bevestigt dat hij of zij verschillende documenten en voorwaarden heeft ontvangen en begrepen. Echter, dit vormt niet expliciet de checklist die vereist is door EPPARG-standaard 10, waarin staat dat zowel de klant als de verstrekker van de informatie een checklist moeten invullen en ondertekenen voordat het contract wordt ondertekend. Deze checklist moet bevestigen dat de klant alle benodigde en relevante informatie heeft ontvangen. De beschikbare informatie bevestigt niet het bestaan van zo'n gezamenlijk ingevulde en ondertekende checklist."
